# ML-bootcamp
basic ML algorithms examples here.

## Description
 let's break down the code step by step:

Import necessary libraries: We import the required libraries, including numpy for numerical operations, train_test_split for data splitting, LinearRegression for linear regression modeling, and matplotlib.pyplot for plotting.

Generate example data: We generate some synthetic data for demonstration purposes. X represents the independent variable, and y represents the dependent variable with some random noise.

Split the data: We split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split(). This helps us evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Create a linear regression model: We instantiate a linear regression model using LinearRegression() from scikit-learn.

Fit the model: We fit the linear regression model to the training data using the .fit(X_train, y_train) method.

Make predictions: We use the trained model to make predictions on the test data using .predict(X_test).

Plot the data and regression line: We create a scatter plot of the actual test data points and overlay the regression line predicted by our model.

Label and display the plot: We add labels, a title, and a legend to the plot, and then display it using plt.show().
